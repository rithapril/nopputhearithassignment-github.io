    <hr>
    <p>
        Going back to my first day in the university, I felt something I could not even put into words. Seeing new faces, new surroundings made me feel like I’m in a very different place. It was my first time to see the people whom I’ll be with for the rest of my stay in the university and it made me nervous for an unknown reason. All of us need to adjust well so that we can survive and know each other well.
