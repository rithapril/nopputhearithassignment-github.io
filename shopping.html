    <h1>Shopping</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
          Firstly, shopping is necessity thing in ours life. Because we need something: food, clothes, shoes, and something...
          Like every girl I enjoy my time shopping because I like to renew my wardrobe and update my style. I prefer to walk around shops, relax, and concentrate on my shopping. However, shopping would get to dull if it became my daily routine. I feel nervous when I can't find what I want. Sometimes shopping can be time when you feel relax, and sometimes you feel angry.
