        <h1>My Habits</h1>
    
        <hr>
       <p>
         I am a person of many habits. Some of them are good, and some of them are bad. I am trying to break my bad habits, but it is not easy.

         One of my good habits is that I am always on time. I hate being late, and I always try to arrive at least 15 minutes early for any appointment. I think it is important to be respectful of other people's time, and I don't want to keep anyone waiting.
