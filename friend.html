        <hr>
        <p>A friend in need is a friend indeed! A true friend will be one who will stay by your side at all times. A real friend stays by you through thick and thin.

            A true friend should be cherished and whose friendship should be safeguarded. Losing a true friend is like losing a treasure. And you may never recover the wealth you lose. A true friend is difficult to come by. So value the friendship of such a friend. Most of all, reciprocate the love your friend has for you. And give your friend a special place in your heart.</p>
