        <p>We need to hard work for prosperity because success and prosperity do not come on their own. If you want to own them, you’ve to work hard to get them. You’ve to work hard until you prove your excellence. There is fierce competition out there. I know I told a while before that it’s not about competition only, but it’s a part of the struggle for success. You want it or not, but there will be many people to give you enough competition in every stage of life. As I said earlier, there is actually no better way except working hard for prosperity.</p>
