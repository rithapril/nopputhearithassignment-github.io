    <h1>Cooking</h1>

        <p>
          Cooking is a necessity for everyone. Everyone in their life time needs to learn how to cook because cooking makes food taste better. Without cooking, everyone would eat raw fruits, vegetables etc. I am still learning how to cook but I consider it my hobby. Cooking is my hobby because I can spend time with my family, it is fun and because of the Food Network Channel. I now a days rarely spend time with my family. I am busy with homework, college applications and ACT/SAT tests. I have no time to sit down a chat with my family. I love my family every much, but I could be better of spending my time finishing all that I have to do to make time for my family.
